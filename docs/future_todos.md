allow mentors to set which age of mentee they prefer and vice versa

Aaron:
-----------
Get modal and button for logging in on front page

Ravi:

- username uniqueness verification

- mandatory checkbox at the end of the instructions "i've read this and agree to it"
- mentor app has a list of instructions / requirements
- drop motivation question from db both mentee & mentor
- make all incomplete fields show red text upon unsuccessful form submission


- aaron's great idea: on admin's mentee list (or mentee show page, if we have one?),
have a dropdown menu of all active mentors and their corresponding match %

- one mentee per mentor for now

MVPS:

- mentor app styling, errors // link directly to this from girlzftw
- Hosting / DNS stuff
- mentee app styling, errors
- Landing page styling = jk, it's just the mentor/admin portal now
- Admin Panel
  - Need to be able approve tees and tors
  - Should be able to assign mentees to mentors *or should they?*
- Mentor Panel
  - view mentees and their info
- Mentors & Mentees have to upload videos


Lower priority:
- mailer
- Mentor Panel - see your potential mentees and select them? Does this need to be thing? Ask nicol.
   - Should mentors have any choosing on this?
   - Ability to set self as full, ie not active
   - Add to column mentee capacity, if full, automatically set inactive
   - update profile option (phone number, etc.)

- Mentee app
  - parent consent form, dl/upload

- Admin Panel
  - current mentor list
  - Be able to update active status
    - lists out mentors info, including their mentees
  - current mentee list
    - lists out mentees info
    - modal for mentee show?

matching concept:
  - have mentors & mentees rank each other, and then have algo match.
  - potentially, mentors and mentees see only X options from which to rank



thoughts:
pop up box to confirm requirements upon submitting form
